## filterlist-collection
A collection of filterlist/blocklist that I made for myself (and for others too).

### I don't care about your service
A blocklist that aims to block any website that force you to log in/create a account. 
(Note that you will definently need to maintain your own whitelist for domains you actually have accounts on)
